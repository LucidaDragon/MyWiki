## What is MyWiki?
MyWiki is a wikipedia-style article engine that runs entirely in the web browser, no backend required. The fact that it requires no backend makes it well suited for hosting wikis through GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started
The first thing you will want to do is name your wiki. You can do this by using a text editor to replace "MyWiki" with the name of your wiki across all of the default files. The name should be alphanumeric only, no spaces.

Once that is done you can start creating pages using "new-template.py" and the "General" template. This will help you get to writing as quickly as possible.
